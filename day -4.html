    @ spread operator 
    @ TERNARY OPERATOR:
    THE TERNARY OPERATOR IS USED TO SHORTEN THE IF-ELSE STATEMENT.IT RETURNS ONE OF TWO VALUES BASED ON A CONDITION.
    SYNTAX: CONDITION ? VALUE IF TRUE : VALUE IF FALSE  
    @ ANONYMOUS FUNCTION:
    A FUNCTION THAT DOES NOT HAVE A NAME IS CALLED AN ANONYMOUS FUNCTION.
    THEY ARE OFTEN USED AS ARGUMENTS TO OTHER FUNCTIONS OR ASSIGNED TO VARIABLES.
    @ FIRST CLASS FUNCTION:
    A FIRST-CLASS FUNCTION IS A FUNCTION THAT IS TREATED AS A FIRST-CLASS CITIZEN. THIS MEANS THAT THE FUNCTION CAN BE PASSED AS AN ARGUMENT TO OTHER FUNCTIONS, RETURNED FROM OTHER FUNCTIONS, AND ASSIGNED TO VARIABLES.
    @ SELF INVOKING FUNCTION:
    A SELF-INVOKING FUNCTION IS A FUNCTION THAT IS IMMEDIATELY INVOKED AFTER IT IS DEFINED. THIS IS USEFUL FOR CREATING A SCOPE FOR VARIABLES AND FUNCTIONS THAT ARE NOT ACCESSIBLE FROM THE OUTSIDE.
    ## SYNTAX: (FUNCTION() {
        // CODE TO BE EXECUTED
    })();
    ## ADVANTAGES OF SELF INVOKING FUNCTION:
    TO OBTAIN DATA PRIVACY:
    DON'T GIVE ACCESS TO CALL ANY FUNCTION OUTSIDE THE FUNCTION
    VARIABLES AND FUNCTIONS DEFINED INSIDE THE SELF-INVOKING FUNCTION ARE NOT
    ACCESSIBLE FROM THE OUTSIDE, WHICH HELPS TO PREVENT NAME COLLISIONS AND KEEPS THE GLOBAL SCOPE CLEAN.
    IT ALLOWS FOR THE CREATION OF A PRIVATE SCOPE, WHICH
    CAN BE USEFUL FOR ENCAPSULATING CODE AND PREVENTING UNINTENDED INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE PROGRAM.
    IT CAN BE USED TO INITIALIZE VARIABLES AND FUNCTIONS THAT ARE ONLY NEEDED
    ONCE, WITHOUT POLLUTING THE GLOBAL SCOPE.
    ## EXAMPLE OF SELF INVOKING FUNCTION:
    (FUNCTION() {
        VAR MESSAGE = "HELLO, WORLD!";
        CONSOLE.LOG(MESSAGE);
    })();


    function no 4 :
    @ First class function - in first class function we can pass a function to a variable and we are treating the variable as a funcn 
    we can pass a fncn inside another funcn as an arguement
    it can return a fncn from a fncn
