            <h2>CallStack:</h2>
            -It is a stack data structure which stores all the execution contexts created during the code execution
            in a LIFO(Last In First Out) manner.
            <h2>Memory Heap:</h2>
            -It is a large unstructured region of memory which is used for dynamic memory allocation where
            variables are allocated memory at runtime.
            <h2>Execution Context Stack:</h2>
            -It is the combination of Call Stack and Memory Heap.
